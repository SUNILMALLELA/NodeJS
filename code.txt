Below is a complete, professional SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document based on your MERN-stack application needs.
You can copy this into Word/PDF — or tell me if you want it reformatted as IEEE-830 compliant, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148-2018 compliant, or with diagrams (DFD, UML, ERD, Use Case diagrams).
Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
MERN Stack Job Management Application
Version 1.0
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This SRS document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a MERN-stack application that manages job creation, job processing, document uploads, and role-based access for Master and Analyst users.
The system will allow Master users to create analysts, manage login credentials, create jobs, assign jobs, download job trackers, and close cases.
Analyst users will update statuses, upload annexures, and close assigned cases.
1.2 Scope
The system is a web-based application built using:
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js + Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT
File Uploads: Multer
The system will provide:
Secure login for Master and Analyst users
Job creation with automatic job ID generation
Uploading of candidate documents (PDF/JPG/PNG)
Status updates by Analysts
Annexure upload by Analysts
Job assignment by Master
Tracker download by Master
The application is intended for internal operational use.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The system is a standalone web application using a client–server architecture.
High-Level Architecture
React frontend communicates with Node/Express backend via REST APIs.
MongoDB handles persistent data storage.
Multer handles file uploads to a server directory.
Authentication uses JWT tokens stored in browser localStorage.
